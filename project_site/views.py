    PROBLEM: CSRF validation is not enforced
        Description:
            Django, by default, enforces CSRF validation (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/howto/csrf/).
            Currently, it is disabled in ../project/settings.py on line 47, which allows the application
            to send POST requests without CSRF validation, exposing a CSRF vulnerability in the register form.
            
        FIX:
            Turn Django's default CSRF validation back on by doing the following:
                1) Go to ../project/settings.py and uncomment line 47
                2) Remove the @csrf_exempt tag below before the register view
                3) Go to ./pages/register.html and add `{% csrf_token %}` inside the form element.

                    Description: 
                        The application allows both brute-forcing, as well as permits weak and known passwords without
                        any extra complexity requirements. Note that Django implements password salting + hashing as a 
                        default, so that is not an issue (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/passwords/).
                        The is_valid-call above only checks that the form elements types and maximum lengths
                        agree with how they are declared in .forms.py.
                            
                    FIX:
                        Implement (at least some level of) control system to force complexity. According to OWASP, the 
                        passwords should not be from a "list of well-known passwords" (as also discussed on the course),
                        but for the sake of simplicity we shall not do this.
                        
                        We could, for example, require the password to be at least of length 8 and consist of at least 1 number
                        and at least 1 special character as follows:
                        
                        import re
                        re_sc = re.compile('[@_!#$%^&*()<>?/\|}{~:]')
                        re_n = re.compile('\d')

                        elif not re_n.search(pw):
                            return HttpResponse("The password must contain a number")
                        elif len(pw) < 8:
                            return HttpResponse("The password must be at least of length 8")

                   FIX:
                       Enforce an access control system that checks that the requesting user owns the particular resource.

                        Django allows raw SQL queries, where SQL injections are a vulnerability in the system
                        when the parameters are being passed directly to the query as above.
                    FIX:
                        If the programmer wants to use Django's raw queries, then the string should be passed
                        as a `params` to the raw-call (see: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/sql/) as follows:

                        Alternatively, a more straightforward fix is to use Django's Object-Relational Mapping and query
                        the corresponding row directly using ORM as commented below in the return statement.

                        The application allows user to "spend" arbitrary amounts as well as negative amounts, which, as an
